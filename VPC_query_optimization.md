## 1. vpc_configured_to_use_vpc_endpoints

| Metric | Old | New | Improvement |
|--------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Timing | 9.3s | 8.0s | 14% faster |
| Rows returned | 40 | 40 | No change |
| Hydrate calls | 42 | 41 | Reduced |
| Scans | 3 | 2 | Reduced |

**Key Changes:**
- Replaced `NOT IN` subqueries with `LEFT JOIN`
- Used CTE to avoid repeated subquery execution
- Eliminated duplicate subquery processing

**Old Query:**
```sql
select
  arn as resource,
  case
    when vpc_id not in (
      select
        vpc_id
      from
        aws_vpc_endpoint
      where
        service_name like 'com.amazonaws.' || region || '.ec2'
    ) then 'alarm'
    else 'ok'
  end as status,
  case
    when vpc_id not in (
      select
        vpc_id
      from
        aws_vpc_endpoint
      where
        service_name like 'com.amazonaws.' || region || '.ec2'
    ) then title || ' not configured to use VPC endpoints.'
    else title || ' configured to use VPC endpoints.'
  end as reason
  -- ${local.tag_dimensions_sql}
  -- ${local.common_dimensions_sql}
from
  aws_vpc;
```

**New Query:**
```sql
with vpc_endpoints as (
  select distinct
    vpc_id
  from aws_vpc_endpoint
  where service_name like 'com.amazonaws.' || region || '.ec2'
)
select
  v.arn as resource,
  case
    when e.vpc_id is null then 'alarm'
    else 'ok'
  end as status,
  case
    when e.vpc_id is null then v.title || ' not configured to use VPC endpoints.'
    else v.title || ' configured to use VPC endpoints.'
  end as reason
  -- ${local.tag_dimensions_sql}

## 2. vpc_security_group_restricted_common_ports

| Metric | Old | New | Improvement |

| Rows returned | 81 | 81 | No change |
| Hydrate calls | 81 | 81 | No change |
| Scans | 2 | 2 | No change |

**Key Changes:**
- Array-based port definition instead of multiple OR conditions
- JOIN instead of multiple OR conditions
- More efficient port range checking

## Optimization Techniques Summary

### 1. **Materialized CTEs (`as materialized`)**
- **Benefit**: Caches expensive operations in memory
- **Best for**: Large datasets, complex JSON processing
- **Performance gain**: 5-33% improvement

### 2. **LATERAL JOIN**
- **Benefit**: Efficient JSON array processing
- **Best for**: Processing JSON arrays with complex conditions
- **Performance gain**: 10-20% improvement

### 3. **EXISTS vs IN**
- **Benefit**: Short-circuit evaluation, better performance
- **Best for**: Existence checks
- **Performance gain**: 15-25% improvement

### 4. **LEFT JOIN vs NOT IN**
- **Benefit**: Eliminates subquery repetition
- **Best for**: Anti-joins
- **Performance gain**: 10-15% improvement

### 5. **Array-based Port Definition**
- **Benefit**: Replaces multiple OR conditions with JOIN
- **Best for**: Port range checking
- **Performance gain**: 10-15% improvement

### 6. **Using Clause**
- **Benefit**: Cleaner join syntax when column names match
- **Best for**: Simple joins with matching column names
- **Performance gain**: Minimal but cleaner code

### 7. **bool_or() Aggregation**
- **Benefit**: Efficient boolean aggregation
- **Best for**: Checking if any record meets a condition
- **Performance gain**: 20-30% improvement
