## Overview

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is legislation that helps US workers to retain health insurance coverage when they change or lose jobs. The legislation also seeks to encourage electronic health records to improve the efficiency and quality of the US healthcare system through improved information sharing.

Along with increasing the use of electronic medical records, HIPAA includes provisions to protect the security and privacy of protected health information (PHI). PHI includes a very wide set of personally identifiable health and health-related data. This includes insurance and billing information, diagnosis data, clinical care data, and lab results such as images and test results.

The HIPAA Final Omnibus Security Rule, which became effective in 2013, implements a number of updates to all of the previously passed rules. The modifications to the Security, Privacy, Breach Notification, and Enforcement Rules were intended to enhance confidentiality and security in data sharing.

HIPAA rules apply to covered entities. These include hospitals, medical services providers, employer-sponsored health plans, research facilities, and insurance companies that deal directly with patients and patient data. As part of the omnibus updates, many of the HIPAA rules that apply to covered entities also now apply to business associates.
