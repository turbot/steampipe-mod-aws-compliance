## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe
```

Install the AWS plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-compliance.git
cd steampipe-mod-aws-compliance
```

### Usage

Before running any benchmarks, it's recommended to generate your AWS credential report:

```sh
aws iam generate-credential-report
```

Start your dashboard server to get started:

```sh
steampipe dashboard
```

By default, the dashboard interface will then be launched in a new browser
window at https://localhost:9194. From here, you can run benchmarks by
selecting one or searching for a specific one.

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `steampipe check` command:

Run all benchmarks:

```sh
steampipe check all
```

Run a single benchmark:

```sh
steampipe check benchmark.cis_v150
```

Run a specific control:

```sh
steampipe check control.cis_v150_2_1_1
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/cli/check#output-formats).

### Credentials

This mod uses the credentials configured in the [Steampipe AWS plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws).

### Configuration

No extra configuration is required.

### Common and Tag Dimensions

The benchmark queries use common properties (like `account_id`, `connection_name` and `region`) and tags that are defined in the form of a default list of strings in the `mod.sp` file. These properties can be overwritten in several ways:

- Copy and rename the `steampipe.spvars.example` file to `steampipe.spvars`, and then modify the variable values inside that file
- Pass in a value on the command line:

  ```shell
  steampipe check benchmark.cis_v150 --var 'common_dimensions=["account_id", "connection_name", "region"]'
  ```

  ```shell
  steampipe check benchmark.cis_v150 --var 'tag_dimensions=["Environment", "Owner"]'
  ```

- Set an environment variable:

  ```shell
  SP_VAR_common_dimensions='["account_id", "connection_name", "region"]' steampipe check control.cis_v150_5_1
  ```

  ```shell
  SP_VAR_tag_dimensions='["Environment", "Owner"]' steampipe check control.cis_v150_5_1
  ```
