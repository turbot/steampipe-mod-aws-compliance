## Description

AWS provides a support center that can be used for incident notification and response, as well as technical support and customer services. Create an IAM Role, with the appropriate policy assigned, to allow authorized users to manage incidents with AWS Support.

By implementing least privilege for access control, an IAM Role will require an appropriate IAM Policy to allow Support Center Access in order to manage Incidents with AWS Support.

## Remediation

### From Command Line:

1. Create a IAM policy for managing incidents with AWS.
    - Create a trust relationship policy document that allows <iam_user> to manage AWS incidents, and save it locally as /tmp/TrustPolicy.json.
```json
      {
        "Version":"2012-10-17",
        "Statement":[
          {
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Principal":{
              "AWS":"<iam_user>"
            },
            "Action":"sts:AssumeRole"
          }
        ]
      }
```

2. Create the IAM role using the above trust policy.

```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name <aws_support_iam_role> --assume-role-policy- document file:///tmp/TrustPolicy.json
```

3. Attach 'AWSSupportAccess' managed policy to the created IAM role:

```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSSupportAccess --role-name <aws_support_iam_role>
```
