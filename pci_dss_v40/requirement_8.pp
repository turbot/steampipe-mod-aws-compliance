These IDs (also referred to as “accounts”) fundamentally establish the identity of an individual or process by assigning unique identification to each person or process to distinguish one user or process from another. When each user or process can be uniquely identified, it ensures there is accountability for actions performed by that identity. When such accountability is in place, actions taken can be traced to known and authorized users and processes."
