## Description

AWS provides customers with the option of specifying the contact information for account's security team. It is recommended that this information be provided.

Specifying security-specific contact information will help ensure that security advisories sent by AWS reach the team in your organization that is best equipped to respond to them.

## Remediation

Perform the following in the AWS Management Console to establish security contact information:

1. Click on your account name at the top right corner of the console.
2. From the drop-down menu Click `My Account`.
3. Scroll down to the `Alternate Contacts` section.
4. Enter contact information in the `Security` section.

**Note**: Consider specifying an internal email distribution list to ensure emails are regularly monitored by more than one individual.
