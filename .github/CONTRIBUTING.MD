# Contributing to CloudKnox Provider

:+1::tada: Thanks for your interest in CloudKnox Provider! :+1::tada:

## Getting Started

Review the Readme.md file to understand the structure of the library.

## Contributions

CloudKnox welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests and will be reviewed by a core contributor.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review
  it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a
  comment.

- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
