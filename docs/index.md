# AWS Compliance Mod

Run individual configuration, compliance and security controls or full compliance benchmarks for `CIS`, `HIPAA`, `NIST 800-53`, `NIST CSF` and `PCI DSS` across all your AWS accounts.

## References

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

[CIS AWS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services/) provide a predefined set of compliance and security best-practice checks for AWS accounts.

[NIST 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-4/final) provides minimum baselines of security controls for U.S. federal information systems except those related to national security.

[NIST CSF](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) provides security standards for managing and reducing cybersecurity risk.

[PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org) provides security standards for the payment card industry.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Steampipe Mods](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/mod-resources#mod) are collections of `named queries`, and codified `controls` that can be used to test current configuration of your cloud resources against a desired configuration.
