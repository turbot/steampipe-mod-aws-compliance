## Description

This control checks whether an AWS Glue machine learning transform is encrypted at rest. The control fails if the machine learning transform isn't encrypted at rest.

Data at rest refers to data that's stored in persistent, non-volatile storage for any duration. Encrypting data at rest helps you protect its confidentiality, which reduces the risk that an unauthorized user can access it.

## Remediation

To configure encryption for AWS Glue machine learning transforms, see [Working with machine learning transforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/console-machine-learning-transforms.html) in the AWS Glue User Guide.
