## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream is encrypted at rest with server-side encryption. This control fails if a Firehose delivery stream isn't encrypted at rest with server-side encryption.

Server-side encryption is a feature in Amazon Data Firehose delivery streams that automatically encrypts data before it's at rest by using a key created in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Data is encrypted before it's written to the Data Firehose stream storage layer, and decrypted after itâ€™s retrieved from storage. This allows you to comply with regulatory requirements and enhance the security of your data.

## Remediation

To enable server-side encryption on Firehose delivery streams, see [Data Protection in Amazon Data Firehose](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/encryption.html) in the Amazon Data Firehose Developer Guide.
