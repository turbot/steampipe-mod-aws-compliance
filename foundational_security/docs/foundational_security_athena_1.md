## Description

This control checks if an Athena workgroup is encrypted at rest. The control fails if an Athena workgroup isnâ€™t encrypted at rest.

In Athena, you can create workgroups for running queries for teams, applications, or different workloads. Each workgroup has a setting to enable encryption on all queries. You have the option to use server-side encryption with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) managed keys, server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys, or client-side encryption with customer managed KMS keys. Data at rest refers to any data that's stored in persistent, non-volatile storage for any duration. Encryption helps you protect the confidentiality of such data, reducing the risk that an unauthorized user can access it.

## Remediation

To enable encryption at rest for Athena workgroups, see [Edit a workgroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-create-update-delete.html#editing-workgroups) in the Amazon Athena User Guide. In the Query Result Configuration section, select Encrypt query results.
