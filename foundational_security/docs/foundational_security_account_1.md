## Description

This control checks if an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account has security contact information. The control fails if security contact information is not provided for the account.

Alternate security contacts allow AWS to contact another person about issues with your account in case you're unavailable. Notifications can be from AWS Support, or other AWS service teams about security-related topics associated with your AWS account usage.

## Remediation

To add an alternate contact as a security contact to your AWS account, see [Adding, changing, or removing alternate contacts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment.html#manage-account-payment-alternate-contacts) in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.
