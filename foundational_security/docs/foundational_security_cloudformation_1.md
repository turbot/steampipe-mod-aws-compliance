## Description

This control checks whether an Amazon Simple Notification Service notification is integrated with a CloudFormation stack. The control fails for a CloudFormation stack if there is no SNS notification associated with it.

Configuring an SNS notification with your CloudFormation stack helps immediately notify stakeholders of any events or changes occurring with the stack.

## Remediation

For information about how to update a CloudFormation stack, see [AWS CloudFormation stack updates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html) in the AWS CloudFormation User Guide.
