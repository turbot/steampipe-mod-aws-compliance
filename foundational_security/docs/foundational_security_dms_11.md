## Description

This control checks whether an AWS DMS endpoint for MongoDB is configured with an authentication mechanism. The control fails if an authentication type isn't set for the endpoint.

AWS Database Migration Service supports two authentications methods for MongoDBâ€”MONGODB-CR for MongoDB version 2.x, and SCRAM-SHA-1 for MongoDB version 3.x or later. These authentication methods are used to authenticate and encrypt MongoDB passwords if users want to use the passwords to access the databases. Authentication on AWS DMS endpoints ensures that only authorized users can access and modify the data being migrated between databases. Without proper authentication, unauthorized users may be able to gain access to sensitive data during the migration process. This can result in data breaches, data loss, or other security incidents.

## Remediation

To enable an authentication mechanism on DMS endpoints for MongoDB, see [Using MongoDB as a source for AWS DMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.MongoDB.html) in the AWS Database Migration Service User Guide.
