## Overview

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a US government-wide program that delivers a standard approach to the security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services.

It is important that Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) understand the impact level of their offering(s) and correlated security categorization when developing their authorization strategy.
Cloud Service Offerings (CSOs) are categorized into one of three impact levels: Low, Moderate, and High; and across three security objectives: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

Confidentiality: Information access and disclosure includes means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.

Integrity: Stored information is sufficiently guarded against modification or destruction.

Availability: Ensuring timely and reliable access to information.

FedRAMP currently authorizes CSOs at the: Low, Moderate, and High impact levels.

### Moderate Impact Level

Moderate Impact systems accounts for nearly 80% of CSP applications that receive FedRAMP authorization and is most appropriate for CSOs where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effects on an agency’s operations, assets, or individuals. Serious adverse effects could include significant operational damage to agency assets, financial loss, or individual harm that is not loss of life or physical. Information on the security controls involved in FedRAMP’s Moderate Baseline can be found [here](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Moderate_Security_Controls.xlsx).

### Low Impact Level

Low Impact is most appropriate for CSOs where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in limited adverse effects on an agency’s operations, assets, or individuals. FedRAMP currently has two baselines for systems with Low Impact data: LI-SaaS Baseline and Low Baseline. The LI-SaaS Baseline accounts for Low-Impact SaaS applications that do not store personal identifiable information (PII) beyond that generally required for login capability (i.e. username, password, and email address). Additionally, information on the security controls involved in FedRAMP’s Low Baseline can be found [here](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Low_Security_Controls.xlsx).

### High Impact Level

High Impact data is usually in Law Enforcement and Emergency Services systems, Financial systems, Health systems, and any other system where loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.
