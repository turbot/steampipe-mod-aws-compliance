## Description

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) supports encryption at rest when using the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service. While disabled by default, forcing encryption at EBS volume creation is supported.

Encrypting data at rest reduces the likelihood of unintentional exposure and can nullify the impact of disclosure if the encryption remains unbroken.

## Remediation

### From Console

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console using [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
2. Under `Account attributes`, click `EBS encryption`.
3. Click `Manage`.
4. Check the `Enable` box.
5. Click `Update EBS encryption`.
6. Repeat for each region in which EBS volume encryption is not enabled by default.

**Note:** EBS volume encryption is configured per region.

### From Command Line

1. Run the following command:

```bash
aws --region <region> ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default
```

2. Verify that `"EbsEncryptionByDefault": true` is displayed.
3. Repeat for each region in which EBS volume encryption is not enabled by default.

**Note:** EBS volume encryption is configured per region.
