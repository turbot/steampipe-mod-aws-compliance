## Description

When an EC2 instance is launched a specified custom security group should be assigned to the instance.

When an EC2 Instance is launched the default security group is automatically assigned. In error a lot of instances are launched in this way, and if the default security group is configured to allow unrestricted access, it will increase the attack footprint allowing the opportunity for malicious activity.
