## Description

In order to have the necessary permissions to access the AWS cloud services and resources Amazon Lambda functions should be associated with active(available) execution roles.

A Lambda function's execution role is an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants the function permission to process and access specific AWS services and resources. When Amazon Lambda functions are not referencing active execution roles, the functions are losing the ability to perform critical operations securely.

## Remediation
