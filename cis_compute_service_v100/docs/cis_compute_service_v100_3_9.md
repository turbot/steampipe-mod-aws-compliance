## Description

You can make all objects private, public (read-only) or private while making individual objects public (read-only). By default when creating a bucket the permissions are set to "All objects are private".

When the Bucket access permissions are set to All objects are public (read-only) â€“ All objects in the bucket are readable by anyone on the internet through the URL of the bucket.
