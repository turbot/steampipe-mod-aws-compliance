## Overview

All CIS Benchmarks focus on technical configuration settings used to maintain and/or increase the security of the addressed technology, and they should be used in conjunction with other essential cyber hygiene tasks like:

  -  Monitoring the base operating system for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with the latest security patches
  -  Monitoring applications and libraries for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with the latest security patches

In the end, the CIS Benchmarks are designed as a key component of a comprehensive cybersecurity program.

This document provides prescriptive guidance for configuring security options for the services within the Compute category in AWS.
