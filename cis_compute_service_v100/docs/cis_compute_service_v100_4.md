## Lambda

Serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. Serverless addresses some of todayâ€™s biggest security concerns as it removes infrastructure management tasks, such as operating system patching, updating binaries, etc. Although the attack surface is reduced compared to non-serverless architectures, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and application security best practices still apply.
