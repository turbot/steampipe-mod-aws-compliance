## Description

Automate the creation of the build environment.

Automating the deployment of the build environment reduces the risk for human mistakes—such as a wrong configuration or exposure of sensitive data—because it requires less human interaction and intervention. It also eases redeployment of the environment. It is best to automate with Infrastructure as Code because it offers more control over changes made to the environment creation configuration and stores to a version control platform.

## Remediation

Verify that the deployment of the build environment is automated and can be easily redeployed.
