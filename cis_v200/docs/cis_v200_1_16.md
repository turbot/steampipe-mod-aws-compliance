## Description

IAM policies are the means by which privileges are granted to users, groups, or roles. It is recommended and considered a standard security advice to grant least privilege -that is, granting only the permissions required to perform a task. Determine what users need to do and then craft policies for them that let the users perform only those tasks, instead of allowing full administrative privileges.

## Remediation

### From Console:

Perform the following to detach the policy that has full administrative privileges:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the navigation pane, click Policies and then search for the policy name found in the audit step.
3. Select the policy that needs to be deleted.
4. In the policy action menu, select first `Detach`.
5. Select all Users, Groups, Roles that have this policy attached.
6. Click `Detach Policy`.
7. In the policy action menu, select `Detach`.

### From Command Line:

Perform the following to detach the policy that has full administrative privileges as found in the audit step:

1. Lists all IAM users, groups, and roles that the specified managed policy is attached to.

```bash
aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn <policy_arn>
```

2. Detach the policy from all IAM Users:

```bash
aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name <iam_user> --policy-arn <policy_arn>
```

3. Detach the policy from all IAM Groups:

```bash
aws iam detach-group-policy --group-name <iam_group> --policy-arn <policy_arn>
```

4. Detach the policy from all IAM Roles:

```bash
aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name <iam_role> --policy-arn <policy_arn>
```
