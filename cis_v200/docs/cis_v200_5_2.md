## Description

Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that no security group allows unrestricted ingress access to remote server administration ports, such as SSH to port `22` and RDP to port `3389`, using either the TDP (6), UDP (17) or ALL (-1) protocols
