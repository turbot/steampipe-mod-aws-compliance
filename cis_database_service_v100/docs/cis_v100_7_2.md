## Description

Creating a VPC, configuring subnets, and creating security groups help isolate your DocumentDB instances within your virtual network and control inbound and outbound traffic.

Setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) protects the private network that has been established from any external networks from interfering. It allows internal networks to communicate with one another with the network that has been established.

Builds a strong connection between internal networks, has a strong connection with the internet, and it secures your data from getting into the hands of an unauthorized party.

## Remediation

The individual is required to create a subnet and configure their inbound and outbound access. Individuals are supposed to configure and route, ensuring the traffic is flowing smoothly without any interference. This control is important because it only allows authorized users to access their resources as they prefer.
