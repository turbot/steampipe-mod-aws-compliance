## Description

Creating your severity group either inbound or outbound rules. Inbound rules allow an individual to create a rule that permits the traffic to go to a specific port depending on which source itâ€™s coming from. Outbound rules enable your instances to connect with one another allow them to connect to the internet. If needed, you can limit the outgoing traffic.

## Remediation

Once created a security group identify the rules you would like to create either inbound or outbound.
