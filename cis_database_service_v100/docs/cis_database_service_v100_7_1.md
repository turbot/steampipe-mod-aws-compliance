## Description

Plan the network architecture to isolate your DocumentDB instances within a secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Configure appropriate security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic to your DocumentDB instances.

Depending on how the network is established between devices, which then helps secure data when transferring it from one server to another. The way the users design their network sets the performance for the system and how it would interact with servers.

## Remediation

To establish connection, the users would need to factor in their virtual private cloud (VPC), create subnet, configure routing, and implement ACLs.
