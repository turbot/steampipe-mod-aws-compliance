## Description

Regularly rotating your Aurora passwords is critical to access management, contributing to maintaining system security. The database password can be rotated in Amazon Aurora, but the access keys refer to the rotation of AWS IAM User access keys.

Updating your password is critical to access AWS resources. This also ensures that your account is being kept safe from a potential threat.
