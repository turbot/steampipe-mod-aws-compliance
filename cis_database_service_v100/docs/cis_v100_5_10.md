## Description

Regularly updating and reviewing the security configuration of your Amazon Keyspaces environment helps ensure that your database is protected against potential vulnerabilities and aligned with your security requirements.

If you are not updating these regularly, your database would most likely become susceptible to a vulnerable attack. Not updating your IAM permission, network, and encryption setting, and controlling audit logging, would lead to the attacker getting into the system which would result in data loss.
