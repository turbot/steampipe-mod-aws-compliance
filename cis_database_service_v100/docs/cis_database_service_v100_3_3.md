## Description

Setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) protects the private network that has been established from any external networks from interfering. It allows internal networks to communicate with one another with the network that has been established.

Builds a strong connection between internal networks and the internet, and it secures your data from getting into the hand of an unauthorized party.
