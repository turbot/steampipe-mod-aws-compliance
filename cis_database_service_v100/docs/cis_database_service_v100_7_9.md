## Description

Set up automated backups for your DocumentDB instances to ensure data durability and recoverability. Consider implementing a disaster recovery plan that includes data replication across different availability zones or regions.

Having the data backed up ensures that all the crucial information is stored securely it defends against any human errors and system errors that resulted in data loss. An organization that has a disaster recovery plan is prepared for any disruption that would impact business operations.

If a business does not have a backup and recovery plan it would have a negative impact on the business, which would result in less productivity, data loss that cannot be restored, and loss of revenue.
