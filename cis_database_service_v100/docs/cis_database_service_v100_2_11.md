## Description

MFA adds an extra layer of protection to your AWS resources. MFA can be used to secure AWS Management Console and CLI access which indirectly affects Aurora and other AWS services.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires an individual to select a second step of verification process to access the platform. The individual has a choice of either selecting a virtual MFA device or a hardware MFA device to complete the process. MFA must also be used when performing specific actions to modify their database.
