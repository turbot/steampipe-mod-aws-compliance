## Description

Using VPC endpoints with Amazon DynamoDB allows you to securely access DynamoDB resources within your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This keeps your traffic off the public internet.

Using VPC endpoint in the DynamoDB helps ensure that the data is secured and that no external networks would have access to the network. It is a private network where the user has access to their desired availability zones and subnets.
