## Description

Security Hub collects security data from across AWS accounts, services, and supported third-party partner products and helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security issues. When you enable Security Hub, it begins to consume, aggregate, organize, and prioritize findings from AWS services that you have enabled, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie. You can also enable integrations with AWS partner security products.

AWS Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in AWS and helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices - enabling you to quickly assess the security posture across your AWS accounts.

## Remediation
