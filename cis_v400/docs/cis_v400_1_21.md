## Description

In multi-account environments, IAM user centralization facilitates greater user control. User access beyond the initial account is then provided via role assumption. Centralization of users can be accomplished through federation with an external identity provider or through the use of AWS Organizations.

Centralizing IAM user management to a single identity store reduces complexity and thus the likelihood of access management errors.

## Remediation

The remediation procedure will vary based on each individual organization's implementation of identity federation and/or AWS Organizations, with the acceptance criteria that no non-service IAM users and non-root accounts are present outside theaccount providing centralized IAM user management.
