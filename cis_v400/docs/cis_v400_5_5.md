## Description

A VPC comes with a default security group whose initial settings deny all inbound traffic, allow all outbound traffic, and allow all traffic between instances assigned to the security group. If a security group is not specified when an instance is launched, it is automatically assigned to this default security group. Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that the default security group restrict all traffic, both inbound and outbound.

The default VPC in every region should have its default security group updated to comply with the following:
-  No inbound rules.
-  No outbound rules.

Any newly created VPCs will automatically contain a default security group that will need remediation to comply with this recommendation.

**NOTE:**When implementing this recommendation, VPC flow logging is invaluable in determining the least privilege port access required by systems to work properly, as it can log all packet acceptances and rejections occurring under the current security groups. This dramatically reduces the primary barrier to least privilege engineering by discovering the minimum ports required by systems in the environment. Even if the VPC flow logging recommendation in this benchmark is not adopted as a permanent security measure, it should be used during any period of discovery and engineering for least privileged security groups.

Configuring all VPC default security groups to restrict all traffic will encourage the development of least privilege security groups and promote the mindful placement of AWS resources into security groups, which will, in turn, reduce the exposure of those resources.

## Remediation

Perform the following to implement the prescribed state:
Security Group Members

1. Identify AWS resources that exist within the default security group.
2. Create a set of least-privilege security groups for those resources.
3. Place the resources in those security groups, removing the resources noted in step 1 from the default security group.

Security Group State

1. Login to the AWS VPC Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home.
2. Repeat the following steps for all VPCs, including the default VPC in each AWS region:
3. In the left pane, click `Security Groups`.
4. For each default security group, perform the following:
  - Select the `default` security group.
  - Click the `Inbound Rule`s tab.
  - Remove any inbound rules.
  - Click the `Outbound Rules` tab.
  - Remove any Outbound rules.

### Recommended:
IAM groups allow you to edit the "name" field. After remediating default group rules for all VPCs in all regions, edit this field to add text similar to "DO NOT USE. DO NOT ADD RULES."
