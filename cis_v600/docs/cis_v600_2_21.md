## Description

AWS CloudShell is a convenient way of running CLI commands against AWS services; a managed IAM policy ('AWSCloudShellFullAccess') provides full access to CloudShell, which allows file upload and download capability between a user's local system and the CloudShell environment. Within the CloudShell environment, a user has sudo permissions and can access the internet. Therefore, it is feasible to install file transfer software, for example, and move data from CloudShell to external internet servers.

## Remediation

### From Console:

1. Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the left pane, select Policies.
3. Search for and select AWSCloudShellFullAccess.
4. On the Entities attached tab, for each item, check the box and select Detach.

### Default Value:

By default, the AWS managed policy AWSCloudShellFullAccess exists but is not attached to any users, groups, or roles. It must be explicitly assigned to grant permissions.
