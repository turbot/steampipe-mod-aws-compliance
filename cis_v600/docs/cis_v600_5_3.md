## Description

Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs or an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment, and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms.

It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for 'root' login attempts to detect unauthorized use or attempts to use the root account.

## Remediation

If you are using CloudTrail trails and CloudWatch, perform the following steps to set up the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription:

1. Create a metric filter based on the provided filter pattern that checks for 'root' account usage and uses the `<trail-log-group-name>` taken from audit step 1:

```bash
aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name `<trail-log-group-name>` --filter-name `<root-usage-metric>` --metric-transformations metricName=`<root-usage-metric>` ,metricNamespace='CISBenchmark',metricValue=1 -- filter-pattern '{ $.userIdentity.type = "Root" && $.userIdentity.invokedBy NOT EXISTS && $.eventType != "AwsServiceEvent"}'
```

**Note**: You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings. Using the same metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.

2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify:

```bash
aws sns create-topic --name <sns-topic-name>
```

**Note**: You can execute this command once and then reuse the same topic for all monitoring alarms.

**Note**: Capture the TopicArn that is displayed when creating the SNS topic in step 2.

3. Create an SNS subscription for the topic created in step 2:

```bash
aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <sns-topic-arn> --protocol <sns-protocol> --notification-endpoint <sns-subscription-endpoints>
```

**Note**: You can execute this command once and then reuse the same subscription for all monitoring alarms.

4. Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs metric filter created in step 1 and the SNS topic created in step 2:

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name `<root-usage-alarm>` -- metric-name `<root-usage-metric>` --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 --namespace 'CISBenchmark' --alarm-actions <sns_topic_arn>
```

## Default Value:

By default, no CloudWatch metric filters or alarms exist to monitor root account activity. Root usage is logged in CloudTrail, but proactive monitoring must be configured.
